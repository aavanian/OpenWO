**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies to the OpenWO app (hereby referred to as
"Application") for mobile devices that was created by Alexandre
Avanian (hereby referred to as "the developer") as a free, open source
application. This application is intended for use "AS IS".

**Information Collection and Use**

The Application collects *NO* information when you download and use
it.

The Application accesses Apple HealthKit data (workout information)
solely to log and display your workouts within the app. This data is
stored in your personal iCloud account and is never transmitted to the
developer or any third party.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
The developer will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by
updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to
consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the
Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the
